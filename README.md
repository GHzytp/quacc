The Quantum Accelerator (QuAcc) supercharges your code to support high-throughput, database-driven density functional theory (DFT). Primarily, QuAcc seeks to enable a seamless interface between the [Atomic Simulation Environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html) (ASE) and [Jobflow](https://github.com/materialsproject/jobflow) for rapid workflow development and prototyping, no matter your favorite DFT package.

This package is heavily inspired by [Atomate2](https://github.com/materialsproject/atomate2), which I also recommend checking out.

## Example
```python
from ase.build import bulk
from jobflow.core.flow import Flow
from jobflow.managers.local import run_locally

from quacc.recipes.emt.core import RelaxMaker as EMTRelaxMaker
from quacc.recipes.vasp.core import RelaxMaker as VaspRelaxMaker

# Make a bulk Cu structure
atoms = bulk("Cu")

# Make a flow consisting of an EMT relaxation followed by a VASP relaxation
job1 = EMTRelaxMaker().make(atoms)
job2 = VaspRelaxMaker(preset="BulkRelaxSet").make(job1.output["atoms"])
flow = Flow([job1, job2])

# Run the flow locally, with all output data stored in a convenient schema
responses = run_locally(flow)
```

## Example with FireWorks
```python
from ase.build import molecule
from fireworks import LaunchPad
from jobflow.core.flow import Flow
from jobflow.managers.fireworks import flow_to_workflow

from quacc.recipes.xtb.core import RelaxMaker as xTBRelaxMaker
from quacc.recipes.orca.core import RelaxMaker as OrcaRelaxMaker

# Make an H2 molecule
atoms = molecule("H2")

# Make a flow consisting of a GFN-FF relaxation followed by an ORCA relaxation
job1 = xTBRelaxMaker(method="GFN-FF").make(atoms)
job2 = OrcaRelaxMaker().make(job1.output["atoms"])
flow = Flow([job1, job2])

# Convert the flow to a FireWorks workflow and add it to launchpad
# Database-friendly results will be deposited in your JobFlow DB
wf = flow_to_workflow(flow)
lpad = LaunchPad.auto_load()
lpad.add_wf(wf)
```

## Installation
1. Run the following command, ideally in a fresh Python 3.10+ environment: `pip install quacc`. For the most recent development version, instead run `pip install git+https://github.com/arosen93/quacc.git`.

2. Follow the instructions in ASE's [documentation](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/calculators.html#supported-calculators) for how to set up the ASE calculator(s) you plan to use.

3. Define the following environment variables (e.g. in your `~/.bashrc`) if you wish to use Jobflow and/or Fireworks, in addition to any that you have set in Step 2. Example `.yaml` files are provided [here](https://github.com/arosen93/quacc/tree/main/.config).

```bash
# Jobflow requirements
# (details: https://materialsproject.github.io/jobflow/jobflow.settings.html)
export JOBFLOW_CONFIG_FILE="/path/to/config/jobflow_config/jobflow.yaml"

# FireWorks requirements
# (details: https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks)
export FW_CONFIG_FILE='/path/to/config/fw_config/FW_config.yaml'
